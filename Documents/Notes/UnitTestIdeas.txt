Possible Unit Tests:

1). Targeting system tests.
	+ Shoot at a stationary object while the droid is stationary (tests reflection of fired shots).
	+ Shoot at a stationary object while the droid is moving (tests accuracy).
	+ Shoot at a moving object while the droid is moving (reinforced test of accuracy).
2). Lightsaber tests (without Vive controller).
	+ When the lightsaber is on, it should produce a "humming" sound.
	+ When the lightsaber is swung, it should produce a "swoosh" sound.
	+ When the lightsabe is turned off, it should play the correct random sound at the right time (no delays).
3). Droid tests.
	+ Motion tests (from very basic manuveaurs (yes, it's spelle wrong) to complex).
	+ Rate of fire tests (rapid burst fire?).
	+ Timing of shots tests (a shot should be fired every ____ second(s)/minute(s)...).
	+ Droid features (splitting into two...).
4). Feature tests. (These may or may not need the headset).
	+ Health tests (if you get shot, you lose health.
